### Understanding Lead Qualification

Lead qualification is the process of determining whether a lead has the potential to become a paying customer. In broadcast advertising, this means evaluating whether a prospect has:

- **Budget** - Can they afford advertising rates?
- **Authority** - Are they the decision-maker for advertising purchases?
- **Need** - Do they have products/services that would benefit from broadcast advertising?
- **Timeline** - When are they looking to start advertising?

### The BANT Framework for Broadcast Ad Sales

**Budget**: Understanding the prospect's advertising budget
- What's their annual marketing budget?
- How much are they currently spending on advertising?
- Are they looking to increase, maintain, or reduce advertising spend?

**Authority**: Identifying decision-makers
- Who makes advertising decisions in their organization?
- Is there a marketing director, CMO, or business owner involved?
- What's the approval process for advertising purchases?

**Need**: Assessing advertising requirements
- What are their business goals?
- Who is their target audience?
- What advertising challenges are they facing?
- How does broadcast advertising fit their marketing strategy?

**Timeline**: Understanding urgency
- When do they want to start advertising?
- Are there seasonal considerations?
- Do they have upcoming product launches or events?

### Qualifying Leads in Dynamics 365

#### Step 1: Review Lead Information
- Open the lead record
- Review all captured information from initial contact
- Check lead source and any notes from previous interactions

#### Step 2: Conduct Qualification Call/Meeting
- Schedule a discovery call or meeting
- Use the BANT framework to guide your questions
- Document findings in the lead record

#### Step 3: Update Lead Status
Based on your qualification, update the lead status:
- **Qualified** - Meets BANT criteria and shows genuine interest
- **Not Qualified** - Doesn't meet criteria or not a good fit
- **Nurture** - Has potential but not ready to buy now

### Converting Qualified Leads to Opportunities

When a lead is qualified and ready to move forward:

#### Step 1: Convert the Lead
1. Open the qualified lead record
2. Click "Qualify" button in the command bar
3. Dynamics 365 will prompt you to create:
   - **Account** (if new company)
   - **Contact** (the person you've been working with)
   - **Opportunity** (the potential sale)

#### Step 2: Set Up the Opportunity
- **Opportunity Name**: Use descriptive naming (e.g., "WXYZ Radio - Q1 2024 Campaign")
- **Estimated Revenue**: Based on budget discussions
- **Estimated Close Date**: From timeline conversations
- **Sales Stage**: Set to appropriate stage (usually "Develop")

#### Step 3: Plan Next Steps
- Schedule proposal presentation
- Set up needs analysis meeting
- Plan campaign strategy session

### Best Practices for Broadcast Ad Sales

**Do's:**
- Always qualify budget early in the conversation
- Understand their target audience demographics
- Ask about previous advertising experiences
- Document all qualification information in Dynamics 365

**Don'ts:**
- Don't assume budget based on company size
- Don't skip the authority qualification
- Don't convert unqualified leads just to boost numbers
- Don't forget to set proper expectations

### Common Qualification Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Small Local Business**
- Budget: $2,000-5,000 monthly
- Authority: Usually business owner
- Need: Local customer acquisition
- Timeline: Often immediate or seasonal

**Scenario 2: Regional Chain**
- Budget: $10,000-50,000 monthly
- Authority: Marketing manager or regional director
- Need: Brand awareness and traffic driving
- Timeline: Quarterly planning cycles

**Scenario 3: National Brand**
- Budget: $100,000+ monthly
- Authority: Media buyer or advertising agency
- Need: Market penetration and brand building
- Timeline: Annual planning with quarterly adjustments

### Tracking Qualification Progress

Use Dynamics 365 to track your qualification efforts:
- **Activities**: Log all calls, emails, and meetings
- **Notes**: Document BANT findings
- **Tasks**: Set follow-up reminders
- **Attachments**: Store relevant documents

### What Happens After Conversion

Once converted to an opportunity:
1. **Account Management**: Build relationship with the account
2. **Opportunity Development**: Create detailed proposals
3. **Campaign Planning**: Develop advertising strategies
4. **Contract Negotiation**: Work through terms and pricing
5. **Campaign Execution**: Implement and monitor advertising

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Lead Qualification Rate**: Percentage of leads that qualify
- **Conversion Rate**: Qualified leads that become opportunities
- **Time to Qualify**: Average time from lead to qualification
- **Qualification Quality**: How many qualified leads close

Remember: Proper qualification saves time and increases your success rate. It's better to have fewer, well-qualified opportunities than many unqualified ones.
