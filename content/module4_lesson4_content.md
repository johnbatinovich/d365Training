### Stage Progression Best Practices

#### Moving Between Stages
**Never skip stages** - Each stage has important activities that build toward success
**Verify stage criteria** - Ensure all requirements are met before advancing
**Document progression** - Record what triggered the stage change
**Update probability** - Adjust based on new information and client feedback

#### Stage Regression
Sometimes opportunities move backward:
- **Propose to Develop**: New stakeholders enter process
- **Negotiate to Propose**: Significant changes to requirements
- **Close to Negotiate**: Legal or approval issues arise

#### Probability Adjustments
While stages have default probabilities, adjust based on:
- **Client engagement level** and enthusiasm
- **Competitive pressure** and alternatives being considered
- **Budget constraints** or approval challenges
- **Timeline pressures** or urgency factors
